## About this document

This document describes the goals of the project, the direction it takes and what to know when working on it. This documented should be adapted as these different points change over time.

<a name="goal"></a>

## Goal

Wav2Bar was created to have a free, open source software to create music visualization (or sound related motion graphics). This software can be used by artists, podcast authors, etc. to make a pleasant video to go with their work. The video can then be published online on social medias or on a webiste.

Wav2Bar is not designed to be a true professional video editing software full of super complex features. Instead, the goal is to have an easy to use software for someone not used to video editing. Help should be provided whenever it is needed, to guide the user as he discover the features.

The current targeted platforms are Windows and Linux (and there is work to do for better Linux support). Mac is currently not considered although it can be somewhat runable from source.

The goal is also to try considerating accessibility issues, even if the project is currently far from being able to cover all accessibility issues. Right now, the first consideration is to have a color palette that works for as many people as possible.

Backward compatibility is also an important part to consider. Upgrading to a newer version shouldn't break user data, or as least as possible. Because nobody wants to keep configuring stuff again or redo projects from scratch all the time.

## Roadmap

<a name="internal-goals"></a>

### Internal goals
- Reduce the amount of global variables and global context code.
- Go towards object oriented code.
- Keep an eye on the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Make more canvas based rendering, less HTML based rendering.
- Try automatic tests. Possible useful resource: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/tutorial/automated-testing-with-a-custom-driver.md

<a name="box-of-ideas"></a>

### Box of ideas

> **Note: I have stopped making plans for future versions as it is more stress for not any additional results. I will focus instead on what I feel like working on, but this list remains a good indication at what I am aiming for. Fixing reported bugs remains a priority though.**

- technical:
    - **convert CLI command ~~(0.3.1)~~.** This quick command would convert the save to a newer said version. There could also be a potential folder support to make migrations easier if you like to keep up to date saves.
    - full CLI with dedicated terminal and script reading
    - better linux support (once I find the good moment to setup a Linux dev environment)
    - More accurate preview (time based instead of frame based)
    - Make FFmpeg installation easier
    - **Increase visualization accuracy/resolution ~~(0.4.0)~~.** The goal is to improve rendering of low frequencies.
- customization:
    - more particle options
    - **New visualizers ~~(0.4.0 and further)~~.** Yes. Finally. Two would be a great goal to start with. I need to experiment stuff.
    - **Extend existing objects customization ~~(0.4.0)~~.** That includes more options for text and particle flows.
    - **Add .lrc lyrics suport ~~(0.4.0)~~.**
- quality of life
    - **Hide/show object feature ~~(0.4.0)~~.** This quality of life feature would help focusing on specific objects during design. It is not set yet if this will be saved or not.
    - **Display object borders on hovering of its settings ~~(0.4.0)~~.** It is not always easy to see the boundaries of an object (like particle flow objects), which doesn't help setting its size. This feature aim to fix this.
    - **Make object creation more intuitive ~~(0.4.0)~~.** (left to do: default size per type...)
    - **Keep track of last used folder in file explorer ~~(0.3.1)~~.** Because always starting from home folder and doing all the clicks again is annoying!
    - **favorite folders in file explorer ~~(0.4.1)~~.** This can act as shortcuts.
    - gradient UI
    - custom color picker
    - mouse interactions to manipulate objects
    - helper to make cool designs by picking between choices.
    - factory templates
- accessibility
    - translations
    - keyboard shortcuts

## Code styling

### Formatting

#### JS
|Type               |Formatting         |example        |
|-                  |-                  |-              |
|variable           |snake case         |`my_var`       |
|constant variable  |capital letters    |`MY_CONST`     |
|lonely function    |pascal case        |`MyFunction`   |
|class              |pascal case        |`MyClass`      |
|private field      |snake case prefixed by an underscore|`_private_field`|
|public field       |snake case         |`public_field` |
|private method     |camel case prefixed by an underscore|`_myMethod`|
|public method      |camel case         |`myMethod`     |
|get/set property   |snake case         |`my_property`  |
|module name        |snake case         |`module_name`  |

#### CSS (old)
|Type               |Formatting         |example        |
|-                  |-                  |-              |
|id                 |snake case         |`#my_id`       |
|class              |snake case         |`.my_class`    |

#### CSS (new) (yes I changed of mind)
|Type               |Formatting         |example        |
|-                  |-                  |-              |
|id                 |kebab case         |`#my-id`       |
|class              |kebab case         |`.my-class`    |

### Tabs
4 spaces.

### Blocks
```js
if (thing === 1) {

} else {

}

function Name() {

}
```

### Decorators
JSDoc decorators `/** @abstract */` and `/** @override */` are used above classes and methods as JavaScript do not support these natively, and they are important to the understanding of the codebase.

### Else
- Prefer `===` over `==`.
- Put some space between root blocks, and group them by feature. You can make visible separations by using comments if needed, for example:
```js
//#####
//TITLE
//#####

//=====
//TITLE
//=====

//Title
//-----

//etc.
```
- You can make basic type tests of the passed arguments that throw errors to limitate possibilities of unwanted data interacting with the code, and limit risks of bugs earlier in the execution. The `utils` module has pre made methods for that purpose (Some may be arguably useless but can help for readability).
 
<a name="organizing-files"></a>

## Organizing files

- **assets:** Non code dependencies (text such as translations, icons, etc.);
- **dev_utils:** Node scripts useful for Wav2Bar development and deployment;
- **docs:** documentation, UML diagrams;
- **html:** HTML code except index.html;
- **js:** JavaScript code except main.js;
- **logs:** automatic logs folder;
- **node_modules:** Node modules! ;
- **out:** Generated packages goes here;
- **temp:** Temporary files for Wav2Bar if writing access is available;
- **user:** User data storage if writing access is available, default settings;

<a name="modules-structuring"></a>

## Modules and packages structuring

Modules are grouped by theme, area or functionality. A package is represented by the following:
- a folder named after the package name;
- a main aggregating module named after the package name, that only serves to export sub modules so they can be all imported through one single module;
- one or more submodules implementing features. Multiple functions or class can be grouped in one module if they are part of the same feature or have a very close relationship. (inheritence of a specific feature that still describe the same feature, group of utilities for the same group of usages, etc.)

A JavaScript file not part of a package (i.e lying directly in the `js` folder) belongs to the global context. They share the same context together (so global variables and function definitions for example). Right now it is the main "module" at the head of all modules.

> Note: Their relationship is documented at `docs/modules.plantuml` and `docs/out/modules/modules.svg`.

<a name="architecture"></a>

## Architecture

Wav2Bar is developped in JavaScript using the Electron framework. It uses a main Node process for system actions, and a renderer process for the rest of the application. When Wav2Bar is started, the main process initiate the application, and launch the renderer process. Then, they communicate through IPCMain and IPCRenderer respectively to send messages, events and requests. There can be additional renderers for specific tasks, such as rendering for export.

The renderer process starts its execution in `index.js` through the global context. Some files of the global context are not systematically used, such as `export_*.js` that relies on specific renderers.

Each renderer process is independant from each other and can communicate through the main process.

> Note: For more information, see the Electron documenation.

Wav2Bar requires FFMpeg in order to be able to export videos. FFMpeg is manipulated through a Node layer using a dedicated library.

<a name="about-the-global-context"></a>

## About the global context

The current goal is to shrink the global context to the minimum (or remove it if it ends up possible). We should avoid by any means to create new features in the global context, add global variables, etc. If we need to add features from code existing in the global context, we should consider if it is possible to migrate it into modules beforehand. If not, we can prepare the code to be movable by making it as independant from the global context as possible.

The global context is the first entry in the program, in `index.js`, through an event listener for when the page is ready. In the global context, modules are imported dynamically and stored in `imports.package_name`.

<a name="about-node-integration"></a>

## About Node integration in the renderer process

Node integration should only be used to require Electron's IPCRenderer. All system actions and use of the Node or Electron api should have a dedicated handler in the main process.

<a name="documenting"></a>

## Documenting

Here is the list of things that should be documented:
- methods, classes, functions...
    - through comments above them, either common comments or JSDoc comments.
    - classes
        - through PlantUML diagrams. PlantUML allows to write UML diagrams by text, which is more friendly with tools like git. You can preview them and generate them through the official utility, or through extensions and plugins. VSCode's PlantUML plugin is used to generate .svg files of the diagrams in `docs/out`. There should be one diagram per module. Classes should be grouped by packages, and classes from other packages should only be named/declared (in this case links within the package are not mandatory either, but can be added if it helps for readability).
    - abstracts, overrides
        - through dedicated JSDoc tags `@abstract` and `@override`. They are important for the integrity of the codebase.
    - complex and verbose topics
        - through dedicated MarkDown files. (examples: Save format, CLI, etc.)

All the documentation is written in the `docs` folder and should be saved in git friendly, text based formats.

<a name="ui-components"></a>

## Creating UI components

Web components are prefered over the older approach of components through classes and are in fact an evolution of it.

In the previous approach, every component is an extension of a class encapsulating a div and some utility functions. Every component can both have a UI parent and a DOM parent in order to be compatible with the DOM. The DOM parent allows to access the DOM nodes while the UI parent allows to use the functionalities of the component itself. This double approach is rather confusing and counter productive. Another caveat is having to instantiate and style all the elements through the JavaScript API, which leads to long constructors affecting readability. Finally, those components are bare bones that requires additional methods to manipulate it like a DOM element. 

[Web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) on the other hand keeps the class approach but integrates perfectly to the native DOM tree and JavaScript APIs. It creates a custom tag resuable anywhere as a classic HTML tag (within chevrons, through createElement, etc.). In addition, the declarated custom properties of the class are accessible through the node instance like any node manipulated in JS. At the same time, since it extends `HTMLElement`, the entire DOM api is supported on those components. Finally, by using HTML templates, the user interface can be written declaratively (to some extent) in a more consise and readable way. Note that web components do not need to be imported, since they are accessed using regular JS APIs instead. (You can use `customElements.get("tag");` to get the class definition.)

Those aren't as powerful as full featured JS frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular or Svelte, however I do not wish to further complexify this project by bringing in other package managers, compilers, etc.

### Creating web components the easy way

While web components comes pretty handy for pure JS development, they are tedious to declare. You need to register them, create a shadow DOM, clone an instance of the template in the constructor (which requires a fetch if we want to separate the template in another file), etc. Thus the process has been abstracted by the `web_ui_custom_component` module. It comes with two important tools: the `WebUICustomComponent` class and the `register` asynchronous function. While the class handles creating the DOM shadow and cloning the template, the `register` function defines the element in `customElements` and cache the template.

To create a component, create a new folder within `ui_components` called `web_<tag_name_underscore>`. Create a JS module and an HTML file named the same way inside your newly created folder. In the HTML file, write your UI withing a `<template>`. In the module, asynchronously call `register` with the tag name separated by hyphens (the actual tag) and the class definition extending `WebUICustomComponent`. in the constructor, call `super(<tag_name_hyphens>, <props_and_states>)`. In order for the component to load, add an `export *` to `ui_components.js`. Finally, to be able to use it in type definitions in JSDoc (from `uiComponents.<type>`), add it to `ui_components.d.ts`.

It should look like this for `ui-foo-bar`:

```
web_ui_foo_bar
|- web_ui_foo_bar.js
|- web_ui_foo_bar.html
```

web_ui_foo_bar.html
```html
<template>
    <!--your UI and style...-->
</template>
```

web_ui_foo_bar.js
```js
import {WebUICustomComponent, register} from "../web_ui_custom_component.js";

const TAG = "ui-foo-bar";
// useful for intellisense and auto completion
const PROPS = {
    prop: "prop"
};
// declared here to have both in sight at the same time
const PROPS_DEFAULTS = {
    prop: "default"
};

// put complex structures in states. The prefix in the value is necessary here
const STATES = {
    allowed_extensions: "states/allowed_extensions"
};
const STATES_DEFAULTS = {
    allowed_extensions: ["#any"]
};

const EVENTS = {
    path_chosen: "path_chosen"
};

export class WebUIFooBar extends WebUICustomComponent {
    /**
     * List of properties of the element, accessible to the user.
     * @enum
     */
    PROPS = {...PROPS};

    /**
     * List of states of the element, accessible to the user.
     * @enum
     */
    STATES = {...STATES};

    /**
     * List of events of the element, accessible to the user.
     * @enum
     */
    EVENTS = {...EVENTS};

    constructor() {
        /**
         * every part here is optional.
         * - Props are values accessible as HTML attributes, and are accessible
         *  using getProp(prop), setProp(prop, value) instead of
         * the state counterpart. You can subscribe to its changes using
         * subscribeToProp(prop, function_handler(value)).
         * /!\/!\/!\ DO NOT USE getState/setState TO ACCESS PROPS! /!\/!\/!\
         * 
         * - States can be used for cases non fitting props, and
         * should preferably have getters and setters for the user.
         * 
         * - Private states can be used as you wish inside the component.
         * 
         * For more details on manipulating them (validators,
         * event subscription, set state, etc.), see the StateMachineMixin.
         */
        super(TAG, {
            props: {...PROPS_DEFAULTS}, //copy declared values.
            states: {...STATES_DEFAULTS},
            private_states: {},
            events: {...EVENTS} 
        });
    }
}
// You could also use an anonymous class if you wanted, though typing it
// allows to use the type elsewhere in the codebase (typeof, JSDoc, etc.).
// The path is from the ui_component folder. It can be ommited if at the root.
await register(TAG, WebUIFooBar, "path/to/folder_containing_component_folder");
```

ui_components.js
```js
//...
export * from "./web_ui_foo_bar/web_ui_foo_bar.js";
//...
```

ui_components.d.ts
```ts
//...
export * from "./web_ui_foo_bar/web_ui_foo_bar.js";
//...
```

It is (again) arguably not as convenient as a framework introducing custom syntax, but will do the job. 

> **Note:** Make sur to export the components in `ui_components` in order for the web components to be loaded! Otherwise you will get errors telling you that the components does not exist.

<a name="versioning-and-git"></a>

## Versioning and Git

`<giant_upgrade>.<major_update>.<small_update>[-beta]`.
- **giant_upgrade:** Switching development phase (beta to release, gigantic rewrite and upgrade of features). Very unlikely to increment.
- **major_update:** Update with multiple new features and breaking changes.
- **small_update:** Small features and changes that are not breaking changes, bug fixes, security patches.
- **-beta:** Beta release. All 0.x.y releases should have it as they are betas.

> Note: **Do NOT use Git LFS!** It caused many issues in the past and should not be touched or used anymore.

<a name="doing-a-release"></a>

## Doing a release

1) verify the version number and type **( /!\ indev -> beta /!\ )** in:
    - `package.json`
    - `package.lock.json`
    - `index.js`
2) update [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)

3) comment out the `openDevTools` line in window functions in main.js
4) do necessary fixes

5) push to master

6) `npm run make` (for local testing or manual builds)
7) test the maked files (if not ok go back to #4)

8) merge the release from `develop` to `main`

9) tag locally on `main` (`git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"`)
10) commit the tag (`git push origin --tags` or `git push origin tag_name`)
> **to get rid of a tag:**
> - `git tag -d v1.4-lw`
> - `git push origin --delete <tagname>`
11)
    - **local build:**
        - Do the GitHub release with appropriate packages and the right tag (source code already managed BUT without node modules)
    - **CI build:**
        - Wait for the tag CI action to finish. It will produce a release draft for the tag, with built packages attached to it.
12) Fill the release information:
```md
[description]

# Changelog
- a

# Note on Betas
Wav2Bar is currently in beta, which means that things actively change (UI, saves, etc.)! Please **backup your saves**, especially when updating Wav2Bar.

# Note for Linux
Right now Linux is not very well supported, but I try my best to make it better bit by bit. For now you should be able to use Wav2Bar without much problem by using the zipped version or using the source code after installing the dependencies (see the README or the wiki). There are some predefined (but not tested) configs to make some other linux packages that you can try.

# Note for Mac
Mac is not supported at this moment, but you can give it a try using the source code (see the README or the wiki).


# Support
For bug reports, please use the issues section of GitHub. For other support, use the discussions section or go over to my Discord server (https://discord.gg/EVGzfdP)
```

13) Update the website links and release numbers (hard coded, yes I know what you will say, and it is OK as is for me right now).
14) OPTIONAL : Blog post
15) Do an archive of the Git repository and GitHub assets

## FAQ

(Picorims answering)

### Why using JavaScript and not TypeScript ?
The project was started when my knowledge of programming was pretty basic. I didn't know classes at the time. Now, the code went through multiple rewrites, and more time should be spent towards improving the software (going out of the endless refactor loop basically and do it gradually). Thus rewriting again by adapting to TypeScript is not worth the work, especially considering the setup is tedious (there is no Webpack or Vite or else in the repository). JavaScript and JSDoc are sufficient right now.

### Why not using React/Vue/Angular/Svelte ?
Same as below. By the time, a custom component system has been setup using ~~`UIComponent` and `EventMixin`~~ `WebUICustomComponent`, which is enough for the needs of the project.

### Why making it a desktop app ? Why not a web app ?
Here, the "server" is shipped with the application. Otherwise, it would require maintaining and hosting a server capable of handling many video exports at the same time. So it is easier and cheaper, in addition to having a better native experience.

### There are many similar apps on the Internet. Why Wav2Bar ?
When I started the project, the only truly free option I knew was SonicCandle, which was discontinued. By the time I discovered some other projects exist as well. But hey, it's a good training and practice project for a student, as it covers many topics at the same time. This is mostly a side project to experiment, train and have fun, so concurrency isn't something I care much about. And the more options for the end user, the better!

### Why current Linux support is not very good ?
I am limited to a virtual machine (VM) on a computer with only an integrated graphics card. I can build and quickly test the software but remain pretty limited (playing the preview can crash the VM altogether). The fact that I don't use Linux often and couldn't dual boot at home doesn't help either. However feel free to report any issue or suggestion regarding Linux support, I really enjoy that platform existing and want to do my best to support it.

### Why not supporting MacOSX ?
Shipping to macOS requires signing packages, and is generally more troublesome than shipping on other operating systems. As I am the only maintainer doing it on my free time, I have to make choices and can't handle everything. (I also don't want to spend thousand of dollars to support a platform). But you can try running Wav2Bar from source, Electron is compatible with Mac after all, and share similarities with Linux.
