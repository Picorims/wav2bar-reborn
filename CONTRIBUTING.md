# Contributing

> **Note:** I currently do NOT accept code contributions, as I can't wrap my mind around which open source licence to use yet. Accepting them would make me lose that choice because of GPL.

First, thanks for your interest in contributing!

If you are willing to partake into big contributions, please contact me first at picorims.contact@gmail.com so we can discuss the topic and I can setup an appropriate branch workflow.

## What to be aware of

Make sure to check out [docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md) for more information on the project itself.

Personal note (Picorims): I work on this project on my free time, while pursuing a computer science degree. That means that my availability is function to my life, work load and health. So please be patient, I may not be immediately available, but I will answer you when possible :).

## Types of contributions

### Filling an issue

When filling an issue, make sure it has not already been reported. If it is security related, mail it to picorims.contact@gmail.com instead.

### Suggesting a new feature

Make sure the suggestion do not already have a dedicated issue opened. Describe it precisely to make sure it is understood and scopped well enough.

### Fixing an issue, adding a feature, modifying the codebase

First, thanks for your interest! Here is a step by step guide for you:
- Add an issue corresponding to your contribution (which also opens discussion before diving too fast straight into code!)
- Fork the repository;
- Create a new branch;
- Work on your contribution;
- If you touched code, make sure the features you modified still work as expected (try to break it if it could be possible, to fix edge cases)
- commit and push your branch to your own repository;
- open a pull request, detailing your contribution, the motivation behind it and a brief explanation of how it works if it is code related;
- Let it be reviewed, and if changes are needed, they will be detailed to you.

### Good first issues

If you are new to contributing, here are some easy contributions:
- opening detailed bug reports;
- issues labelled as good first issues if any is available;
- documentation detailing;
- typos in documentation, README, assets files, etc.

### Contributions that doesn't help

Make sure to check the following list before contributing:
- Fixes about forgotten spaces or else alone are not worth it.
- A too vague issue, or an issue with no reproducing steps is unlikely to be fixed.
